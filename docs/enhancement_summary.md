## 6. Implementation Notes

### Database Migration
The enhancements require a database migration to add new tables and update existing ones. The migration should be handled carefully to preserve existing data.

### Default Values
- Default grill configuration: 1 grill with 4 slots
- Default store hours: 6am-10pm for all days
- Default time periods: 6am-10am, 10am-2pm, 2pm-6pm, 6pm-10pm, plus 10pm-2am and 2am-6am for 24-hour stores

### Hold Time Logic
- Products have a 4-hour hold time from when they're added to the grill
- Visual indicators change color as the expiration time approaches
- Expired products are highlighted and require action (discard or reset)

### Store Hours Logic
- Regular store hours apply to all days by default
- Individual days can be set to 24-hour operation
- Time period availability is determined by store hours configuration
